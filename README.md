# Restricted Boltzmann Machines for Collaborative Filtering

A well-known technique used mainly for designing recommender systems is collaborative filtering. In this project, weâ€™ll use the RBM algorithm to recommand for a random user a set of specified movies.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

To run the program, you'll need:

```
Python version 3.7.3
Jupyter notebook
```

### Dataset
The Dataset used can be found in : https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/

Inside, there're 1,000,209 anonymous ratings of approximately 3,900 movies made by 6,040 MovieLens users 
who joined MovieLens in 2000.

### Installing

To get the env running, you'll need the following packaged installed


```
Pip3 install numpy
Pip3 install matplotlib
Pip3 install pandas
Pip3 install torch==1.3.1+cpu torchvision==0.4.2+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```
